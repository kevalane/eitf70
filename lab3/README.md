## Sanity Check

### HA1: Number of clock cycles for 0.1s delay

Since T = 1/f, will require 1.6*10^6.

### HA2: Number of bits to count

21 bits, number is 0b110000110101000000000

### HA3: Number of registers for delay

Given we delay by arithmetic and breq when number in register
equals our 21 bit number, we'll need 3 registers of 8bits each.

### HA4:
